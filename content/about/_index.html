<p>Hi, I’m Allison! I’m a lecturer at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management (UC Santa Barbara) where I teach statistics, data analysis and presentation skills.</p>
<p>I’m also an artist with a background in <em>plein air</em> landscape oil painting. Recently I’ve moved into digital art and design, and am currently an Artist-in-Residence at the <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/">National Center for Ecological Synthesis and Analysis</a>.</p>
<p>I split my time between Santa Barbara and the Eastern Sierra Nevada, and enjoy hiking, fly-fishing, and wandering aimlessly in the sagebrush with my partner Greg and our dog Teddy.</p>

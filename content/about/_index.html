<p>Hi, I’m Allison! I’m a <a href="https://allisonhorst.github.io/">continuing lecturer</a> at the <a href="http://bren.ucsb.edu/">Bren School of Environmental Science and Management</a> (UC Santa Barbara) where I teach statistics, data analysis and science communication.</p>
<p>I’m also an artist with a background in <em>plein air</em> landscape oil painting. Recently I’ve moved into digital art and design, and am currently an <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/11/18/artist-in-residence/">Artist-in-Residence</a> at the <a href="https://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>.</p>
<p>I split my time between mountains in Santa Barbara and Mono counties, where I enjoy hiking, fly-fishing, and wandering aimlessly in oak forests and sagebrush with my partner Greg and our dog Teddy.</p>

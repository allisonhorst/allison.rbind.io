Allison is a lecturer at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management (UC Santa Barbara), where she teaches statistics, data analysis and presentation skills. 

She is also an artist with a background in *plein air* landscape oil painting. Recently she has moved into digital art and design, and is currently an Artist-in-Residence at the National Center for Ecological Synthesis and Analysis. 

Allison splits her time between Santa Barbara and the Eastern Sierra Nevada, where she hikes, fishes, and wanders with her partner Greg and their dog Teddy.

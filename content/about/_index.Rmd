Hi, I'm Allison! I'm a [continuing lecturer](https://allisonhorst.github.io/) at the [Bren School of Environmental Science and Management](http://bren.ucsb.edu/) (UC Santa Barbara) where I teach statistics, data analysis and science communication. 

I'm also an artist with a background in *plein air* landscape oil painting. Recently I've moved into digital art and design, and am currently an [Artist-in-Residence](https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/11/18/artist-in-residence/) at the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/). 

I split my time between mountains in Santa Barbara and Mono counties, where I enjoy hiking, fly-fishing, and wandering aimlessly in oak forests and sagebrush with my partner Greg and our dog Teddy.

# Just testing a post again
## Still swimming

*trying out some formatting for font type*

**more TESTING**

and some LaTeX $a = bx^2-7$

Then a code chunk: 
```{r}

Allison <- 10
Horst <- 15

ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point()


```


Seems to recognize pathway from the post folder (I think), but doesn't work when rendered...probably some really basic screw up here....

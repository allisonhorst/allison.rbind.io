In the past I've always asked students to create their *best possible graphs* in `ggplot2` to practice creating clear, engaging data visualizations. Recently, I've realized value in adding a few early exercises that encourage students to make their **worst**.

**Why is it good to make ggplot2 graphs so (intentionally) bad?**

Here are four ways that creating a purposefully disgusting graph promotes learning and exploration in `ggplot2`: 

1. Making **the worst** graph encourages creativity while eliminating the stress of producing a perfect final visualization (unless, of course, it's perfectly hideous)
2. Making **the worst** graph requires extensive customization and code
3. Making **the worst** graph helps students critically think about and identify what can make a graph "bad"
4. Making **the worst** graph is surprisingly freeing and fun

I was recently inspired to try my absolute dataviz worst by a [#tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) prompt using data from [Sarah Leo's efforts to improve imperfect graphs in The Economist](https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368). 

Instead of trying to recreate or further improve on their graphs, I decided to use my powers and energy for a much different purpose. A darker, more hideous purpose... 

Behold, my worst!

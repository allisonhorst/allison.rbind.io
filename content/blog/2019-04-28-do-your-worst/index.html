<p>In the past I’ve always asked students to create their <em>best possible graphs</em> in <code>ggplot2</code> to practice creating clear, engaging data visualizations. Recently, I’ve realized value in adding a few early exercises that encourage students to make their <strong>worst</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Why is it good to make ggplot2 graphs so (intentionally) bad?</strong></p>
<p>Here are four ways that creating a purposefully disgusting graph promotes learning and exploration in <code>ggplot2</code>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Making <strong>the worst</strong> graph encourages creativity while eliminating the stress of producing a perfect final visualization (unless, of course, it’s perfectly hideous)</li>
<li>Making <strong>the worst</strong> graph requires extensive customization and code</li>
<li>Making <strong>the worst</strong> graph helps students critically think about and identify what can make a graph “bad”</li>
<li>Making <strong>the worst</strong> graph is surprisingly freeing and fun</li>
</ol>
<p>I was recently inspired to try my absolute dataviz worst by a <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">#tidytuesday</a> prompt using data from <a href="https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368">Sarah Leo’s efforts to improve imperfect graphs in The Economist</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to recreate or further improve on their graphs, I decided to take it a different direction. A much darker direction.</p>
<p>Behold, my worst!</p>

<p>Clear and engaging data visualization is a critical part of science communication, and one that I emphasize in all courses I teach at the Bren School. So in the past, I’ve stressed the importance of customizing graphs to make them the best.</p>
<p>Recently, I’ve realized value in adding exercises that require students to make their <strong>worst</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Why is it sometimes <strong>good</strong> to be so (intentionally) <strong>bad</strong>?</em></p>
<p>Key word: <em>intentionally</em>. Creating a purposefully disgusting graph can promote learning in several useful ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Making <strong>the worst</strong> graph encourages creativity</li>
<li>Making <strong>the worst</strong> graph requires extensive customization</li>
<li>Making <strong>the worst</strong> graph makes us identify specific ways that a graph can be “bad”</li>
<li>Making <strong>the worst</strong> graph eliminates the stress of producing a perfect final product (…unless, of course, it’s perfectly awful)</li>
<li>Making <strong>the worst</strong> graph is surprisingly freeing and fun</li>
</ol>

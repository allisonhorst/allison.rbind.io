Hi everyone, I'm Allison! I'm a continuing lecturer at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara, where I teach statistics, data analysis, and science communication. I'm also the current RStudio Artist-in-Residence, and you can find some of my R- and stats-related artwork [here](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations).

When I'm not teaching or painting, I can often be found wandering through the oak forests and sagebrush of the Los Padres and Inyo National Forests with my partner Greg and our dog, Teddy.

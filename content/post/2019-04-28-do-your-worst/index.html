<p>In the past I’ve always asked students to create their <em>best possible graphs</em> in <code>ggplot2</code> to practice creating clear, engaging data visualizations. Recently, I’ve realized value in adding a few early exercises that encourage students to make their <strong>worst</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Why is it good to make ggplot2 graphs so (intentionally) bad?</strong></p>
<p>Here are four ways that creating a purposefully disgusting graph promotes learning and exploration in <code>ggplot2</code>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Making <strong>the worst</strong> graph encourages creativity while eliminating the stress of producing a perfect final visualization (unless, of course, it’s perfectly hideous)</li>
<li>Making <strong>the worst</strong> graph requires extensive customization and code</li>
<li>Making <strong>the worst</strong> graph means critically thinking about and identifying contributors to “bad” graphs</li>
<li>Making <strong>the worst</strong> graph is surprisingly fun</li>
</ol>
<p>I was recently inspired to try my absolute dataviz worst by a <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">#tidytuesday</a> prompt using data from <a href="https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368">Sarah Leo’s efforts to improve imperfect graphs in The Economist</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to recreate or further improve on their graphs, I decided to use my powers and energy for a much different purpose. A darker and more anarchistic purpose…</p>
<p>Behold, my worst!</p>

<p>The undiscerning eye might think “these graphs are abominations and there was clearly no effort put into them.”</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p><strong>It’s a long dive from ggplot2 defaults into the depths of truly terrible DataViz, and it takes creativity and effort to keep sinking</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are just a few things I learned or re-learned during my nosedive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrange multiple graphs with <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/introduction.html"><strong>cow</strong>plot</a> by <a href="https://github.com/clauswilke"><strong>C</strong>laus <strong>O</strong>. <strong>W</strong>ilke</a></li>
<li>Add figure labels and subtext</li>
<li>Expand figure margins to let axis labels breathe</li>
<li>Update fonts and colors in all graph components</li>
<li>Convert to polar coordinates</li>
<li>Customizing date formatting on axes</li>
</ul>

<p>Through the process of trying my worst I learned some new customization skills, created useful reference code for future ggplot2 efforts, and had fun – it felt oddly liberating to be deliberately and creatively awful.</p>
<p>From now on, I’ll be adding a few early <code>ggplot2</code> activities requiring students to do their absolute dataviz worst. There’s plenty of room at the bottom, and we can learn a lot <em>and</em> have fun on our way down.</p>

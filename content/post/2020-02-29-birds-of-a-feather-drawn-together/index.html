<p>The “<a href="http://community.rstudio.com/bof">Birds of a Feather</a>” (BoF) sessions at the <a href="https://rstudio.com/conference/">2020 RStudio Conference</a> were a place where R-users with similar backgrounds, interests, and aspirations could connect in a low-stress social setting. In other words - these sessions let “birds of a feather flock together.” Building on the 2019 conference swag, we rolled out a bunch of new BoF buttons for rstudio::conf 2020.</p>
<p>Here we’ll share the process for how some of the designs were created, including several that truly involved a flock of contributors (names for groups of birds are from <a href="https://www.birdspot.co.uk/articles/collective-nouns-for-birds">Bird Spot</a>).</p>
<div id="well-what-can-we-realistically-fit-on-a-1.5-button" class="section level3">
<h3>Well, what can we realistically fit on a 1.5&quot; button?</h3>
<p>The cool and challenging thing about designing the BoF buttons was the size restriction. In a 1.5&quot; button, we wanted to create designs that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reflect the group name and/or community</li>
<li>Include at least one bird</li>
<li>Are obviously distinguishable for each group</li>
<li>Add some readable text</li>
<li>Oh also, all while setting an approachable tone.</li>
</ul>
<p>It turns out the answer to “What can you fit on a 1.5” button?&quot; is…actually quite a lot. Here are a few of the designs:</p>
</div>
<div id="data-science-team-leaders" class="section level3">
<h3>Data science team leaders</h3>
<p>Featuring 80’s beach volleyball sandpiper coach leading a team of R users:</p>
<p><img src="team_leaders_v1.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> a group of sandpipers can be called a <em>fling</em> or a <em>bind</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="natural-language-processing" class="section level3">
<h3>Natural language processing</h3>
<p>Featuring a wordy bird - a parrot!</p>
<p><img src="natural_language_processing_v1.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Fun facts:</strong> Groups of parrots are sometimes called <em>companies</em>, a <em>prattles</em>, or <em>pandemoniums</em>. Also, parrots are the only birds that can use their feet (like hands) to serve themselves food. And one more thing - the text in the background of this design is a line from Patrick Rothfuss’ <em>The Name of the Wind</em> (one of artist <span class="citation">@allison_horst</span>’s favorite books).</p>
</div>
<div id="the-spatially-aware-carrier-pigeon" class="section level3">
<h3>The spatially aware carrier pigeon…</h3>
<p>…checking flight routes before setting off on their next delivery:</p>
<p><img src="spatial_v2.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> A group of pigeons is sometimes called a <em>kit</em> or a <em>loft</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="community-driven-designs" class="section level1">
<h1>Community-driven designs</h1>
<p>Several of the designs - especially R-Latin America, R-Africa, and R-Ladies - depended on recommendations, insights, and feedback from multiple members of those communities. Here, we’ll highlight elements and contributors of several community-driven designs.</p>
<div id="r-latin-america" class="section level3">
<h3>R-Latin America</h3>
<p><img src="r_latin_america_bof_v2.png" /></p>
<p>The R-Latin America BoF button was truly a collaborative effort, with every detail - from bird to branch - created based on ideas and input from R-Latin America community members. Massive thanks to the R-Latin America design contributors (and thank you to <span class="citation">@yabellini</span> for providing this compiled list &amp; text):</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/_lacion_">Laura Ación</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Fichulina">Marcela Alfaro</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/yabellini">Yanina Bellini</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/July_Benitezs">Juliana Benitez</a> (expert ornithologist!), <a href="https://twitter.com/d_olivaw">Elio Campitelli</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PaobCorrales">Paola Corrales</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/cantoflor_87">Florencia D’Andrea</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/pacocuak">Natalia da Silva</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/pmnatural">Priscilla Minotti</a>; <a href="https://twitter.com/rivaquiroga">Riva Quiroga</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vilsurr">Vilma Romero</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/GabySandovalM">Gabriela Sandoval</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/HeathrTurnr">Heather Turner</a>; and the <a href="https://twitter.com/LatinR_Conf">LatinR Conference Community</a>!</p>
<p>These contributors are from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Perú, Uruguay and the UK, and belong to R-Ladies Chapters and R User Groups in these countries. The final picture was chosen for the vote of the broader LatinR Conference Community.</p>
<p>Here are some insights into the final design elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bird species is the chingolo (<em>Zonotrichia capensis</em>) which was chosen because it seemed to be the bird that is native to many Latin American countries, and is also unique to Latin America. It was one of a number suggested by ornithologist <a href="@july_benitezs">Juliana Benitez</a>!</li>
<li>The chingolo is standing on a tilde (“~”) branch, used in letter eñe (ñ)</li>
<li>The color bands on the tilde represent colors on flags for Latin American countries</li>
<li>The shape of Latin America is represented on the bird’s chest</li>
<li>The bright green background is a nod to the astonishing biodiversity in Latin America</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="africar" class="section level3">
<h3>AfricaR</h3>
<p><img src="africar.png" /></p>
<p>The AfricaR BoF button was designed with suggestions and feedback from AfricaR community leaders <a href="https://twitter.com/Shel_Kariuki">Shelmith Kariuki</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Denironyx">Dennis Irorere</a>.</p>
<p>Some design elements for the AfricaR button:</p>
<ul>
<li>The colors (orange, purple and black) are borrowed from (and inspired by) the existing <a href="https://twitter.com/AfricaRUsers">Africa R Users</a> hex design</li>
<li>The shape of the continent is in orange (and outlined by data points, with a ggplot-inspired background grid)</li>
<li>The ostrich was suggested by Shelmith and Dennis as a representative bird</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="r-ladies" class="section level3">
<h3>R-Ladies</h3>
<p><img src="rladies_bof.png" /></p>
<p>The R-Ladies BoF button started with an idea from R-Ladies founder <a href="https://twitter.com/gdequeiroz">Gabriela de Quiroz</a>, who suggested a gull as a nod to both R-Ladies’ beginnings in San Francisco, and to this year’s conference location!</p>
<p>With feedback from Gabriela and the R-Ladies leadership team including <a href="https://twitter.com/_lacion_">Laura Ación</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ledell">Erin LeDell</a>, and RStudio’s <a href="https://twitter.com/minebocek">Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel</a>, the final design features the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A flock (or colony) of gulls, species chosen because it’s common to San Francisco, where R-Ladies began!</li>
<li>The gulls are riding an updraft of air together</li>
<li>The purple-to-black gradient is inspired by the R-Ladies color scheme</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-whole-collection" class="section level3">
<h3>The whole collection</h3>
<p>This year, there were 24(!) different Birds of a Feather buttons. When we put them all together, here’s the flock for the 2020 conference (with more planned for next year):</p>
<p><img src="all_bof.png" /></p>
<p>We hope that everyone can find a bird that they relate to, and we look forward to meeting many of you at future RStudio Conference BoF sessions!</p>
<p>So, just one final question: <strong>Which bird(s) are you?</strong></p>

<p>Since I started drawing R- and stats-related illustrations for my students in 2018, I have been overwhelmed by the reception from the #rstats community on twitter.</p>
<p>I am extremely excited to share that as of October 2019, I am <a href="https://rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>â€™s first Artist-in-Residence!</p>

<p>You can read more about my motivation and goals for the position on the <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2019/11/18/artist-in-residence/">RStudio blog</a>.</p>
<p>I look forward to sharing a whole bunch more art with you over the next year!</p>
<p>Allison</p>
